# luatools

In progress and incredibly incomplete package for cross-format LuaTeX
Lua-based helper functions. Roughly half of the features don't work at
all, and the other half are buggy and slow, so don't use this yet.

This will be finished eventually, at which point it will be released to
CTAN (probably under a different name though). Until then, there's
nothing to see here.


## License

Don't use this yet. At some point, this will be finished and will have a
free license, but if you _really_ want to use it now, then email me.
